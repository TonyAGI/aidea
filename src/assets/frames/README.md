# GSAP Animation Frames

Place your animation frame images here for the scroll-driven canvas animation on the landing page.

## Frame Naming Convention

Name your frames sequentially:
- `frame_000.png` through `frame_299.png` (300 frames total)
- Or any sequential naming pattern (e.g., `frame_0.jpg`, `frame_1.jpg`, etc.)

## Supported Formats

- PNG
- JPG/JPEG
- WEBP

## How It Works

The Home page will automatically detect frames in this directory and use them for the scroll-driven canvas animation. If no frames are found, a static hero section will be displayed instead.

## Frame Requirements

- Recommended: 1920x1080 or similar aspect ratio
- Consistent dimensions across all frames
- Sequential numbering for proper animation playback
